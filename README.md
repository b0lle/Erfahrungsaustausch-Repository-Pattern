# Instructions:
1. Create a ProductRepository class that will handle the data storage and retrieval.
2. The ProductRepository class should have methods for adding a product and retrieving all products.
3. Refactor the ProductService class to use an instance of ProductRepository for data storage and retrieval.
4. Ensure that the ProductService class is not directly manipulating the data storage.
The Repository Pattern provides a way to abstract data retrieval and persistence, making the rest of the application agnostic to the underlying data storage mechanism. This makes the code more maintainable and testable. Good luck with your refactoring! ðŸ˜Š
